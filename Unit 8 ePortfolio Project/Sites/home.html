Pulse Mobile shop is a mobile phone and tablet retailer company that operates in Chennai. They have several outlets and are very successful. As a part of their fall collection, they are introducing the new iPhone 6 to their stores. <br><br>

The shop requires interactive multimedia content that can be placed on their website. This project covers the design, testing and production of the content that would be placed on Pulse’s website.<br>
<br>
 This product would be used to attract customers and show them the goodness of the new iPhone. This would mainly be to increase the shop’s customer base and also familiarize the user with the shop so that they are more likely to buy from their store.
