<td>Linking all pages</td>
<td>All pages are linked to each other successfuly</td>
<td>The pages were all linked, however, few errors occured and few pages were not found </td>
<td>The errors were because of incorrect instance names in the Action script. Few the pages not being found due to wrong file references</td>
<td>I corrected the script and file name references</td>

<td>The movie clip</td>
<td>The video is suppose to play at start of the scene</td>
<td>The scene was present but the video did not play</td>
<td>The movie clip didn't play as it the reference video file was shifted to another location</td>
<td>Therefore, I placed the video along with the .fla file</td>

<tr>
<td>The 360 view of the iPhone 6</td>
<td>The user should be able to get a full 360 rotation of the phone</td>
<td>The images were not shifting smoothly, as a single click rotated the component by multiple frames rather than one</td>
<td>The error was in the if statement of the code and the instance names</td>
<td>I adjusted the scroll rate in the code and the if statement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Change the size of the thumbnail</td>
<td>The size of the image should change if the mouse is hovering over it</td>
<td>The image was not being scaled up</td>
<td>The script had the wrong symbol and frame references</td>
<td>I edited the symbols that were present inside the movie clip so that the animation of zooming out played on smoothly.</td>
