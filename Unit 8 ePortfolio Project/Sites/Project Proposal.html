Project Proposal- Multimedia content for Pulse Mobile Shop<br>
<br>

To the organizer- Pulse CEO<br><br>


Proposed by Flourish Multimedia Creations- Sayeeshwar Girish<br><br>


The project is about:<br>
<br>

This proposal is for the Pulse Mobile Shop. They operate in Chennai across several outlets successfully. This content will be used to promote the new iPhone 6 and attract customers to their shop.<br>
<br>

<b>It will deliver..</b><br>
<br>

The ad will enable the shop to reach out to a larger audience as it is possible to showcase the online ad compared to traditional methods such as billboards or news paper ads. Anyone can view this. It also allows for more interactive content that allows the user to interact with the ad. Also, the content can include videos, sounds and animations compared to traditional static content such as pictures and posters.<br>
<br>

<b>Risksâ€¦</b><br>
<br>

There is really no risk for this sort of product. This is because the format of the content is irreproducible. However, in some instances, it has been shown that dedicated programs can decode multimedia products into their code. In that case, they can replicated and published. So someone else can gain credit for your work. But, all this is prevented under the Data Protection Act.
<br>
<br>
<b>Its impacts:</b><br>
<br>

Once this content is in place, a lot of money can be saved as other forms of advertising would be unnecessary. Therefore, the savings level would increase. Also, there would be a lot more customer flow due to the ads and thus higher profits. Thus, the financial department of the shop would be boosted significantly.<br>
<br>

<b>Stakeholders:</b><br>
<br>

As you are the main stakeholder, you will be majorly affected. The number of customers visiting your shop would increase significantly. Other stakeholders such as the public who view the ad are affected such that they would be prompted and encouraged to buy the product.<br>
<br>
<b>
Drawbacks:</b><br>
<br>

The main drawback would be that the staff would be affected. If the ads that are used previously are discontinued (posters and news paper ads), the staff would no longer have any use. Therefore, they might have to be fired. Although it is a advantage of you, it is a disadvantage from their point of view. It would be a disadvantage from your point of view too if they are not fired as they would be paid for doing nothing.<br>
<br>

<b>Functional requirements:</b><br>
<br>

The functional requirement for this product is a multimedia advertisement that showcases the features and details of a new phone so that internet users can explore the phone. It will be easy to load and entertaining to use.<br>
<br>
<b>
Implementation</b>
<br>
<br>

The project proposal should be finished by end of April. The product should be ready in an appropriate time frame.
<br>
<br>
<b>Resources needed:</b>
In order to test and run the content, a computer that runs Adobe Photoshop, Flash, Audacity would be needed. The main people involved would be me(designer), you(organizer) and some of your staff who make your existing ads.<br>
<br>


<b>
Recommendations:</b><br>
<br>

Since the database needs to be as per your needs, as much as possible, I need to conduct meetings with you every time there is a major update and get your feedback and satisfaction. This could be used to refine the rough initial model into a final model.
<br>
<br>
<b>Decisions</b>
<br>
<br>
In this case, I have dedcided to use Adobe Flash for creating the content, as it is commonly available and is fairly easy to understand by others who want to look at the source file. Also, it is quite common nowadays in the industry. Also, it is quite user friendly. At the same time, it is quite rich in features and is powerful enough to render the content required for this project.

<br>
<br>
Thanks for going through this proposal and I will look forward to working on your project<br>
