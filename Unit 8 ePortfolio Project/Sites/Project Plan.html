<b>Number of phases</b><br>
<br>
From the above screenshot of the Gantt Chart, it can be seen that there are totally 4 key phases. They are:
<br>
<br>
Requirements- <br>
<br>
This covers the understanding of requirements needed by the client. This is likely to take upto 10 days.
<br>
<br>
Implementation- <br>
<br>
This section covers the action of gathering the required resources- this includes pictures, videos and audio files for the end project. This phase also includes the use of all these resources to form a finished product. This would constitute writing the code, designing the content and a review of the product.
<br>
<br>
Testing-<br>
<br>
This involves making sure all the links work as well as all the content is compatible in all browsers and devices. This involves internal testing(done by team members)and external testing (done by a test audience). The mistakes are then corrected and a final checkup takes place to make sure there are no more mistakes
<br>
<br>
Release-<br>
<br>
Although this phase does not take any time, this is crucial as this signifies the release of the final prototype software to the client. <br>
<br>
After this, any compaints are reported to the designer, who then makes the minor changes and relays it back to the client.
<br>
<br>

The allocated hours are mentioned above. Although the initial design of the chart looked different, this is its final appearance after modification over different tasks.
