According to me, this project has successfully achieved its goal by the end of the creation phase.  The project management software has been very useful to me.<br><br>

 Mainly, the software has helped me organize my entire project with a Gantt chart. It has been a crucial guide through the course of the whole project. It has helped me keep a track of the progress of the project by organizing meetings with the team leaders and recording their suggestions. It also keeps a track of their evaluation of my product. <br>
<br>

 The project achieved what it originally set out for. Due to its success, many more customers have begun visiting the ‘Pulse Mobile’ shop and its profits and revenue have been increasing at a constant rate, much to the satisfaction of its CEO.<br>
<br>


Also, many more people now know about the new iPhone 6 due to this. All objectives were met and done so on time. All objectives that were part of the proposal have been met such as increased customer flow to the shop and higher revenue for the company.<br>

<br>
<b>My performance:</b>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I am satisfied with my final product.  I have been carefully planning this project from the moment I was assigned to it. I have also added a lot of entertaining animations to capture the user’s attention<br>
<br>
I feel I could have finished this project well before its completion date, as I may have lost some time in planning the entire product right from the proposal to the Gnatt charts.

<b>Effectiveness of project management methods:</b><br>
<br>

One of the main methods, using a Gantt chart was a big hit as it was very easy to keep track of events. It was easier to modify my goals if I ran out of time or failed to finish a goal on time. The use of meeting s to take suggestions was great too as I got many useful points that way.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>

<br>
In the end, I have learnt a lot on project management from this unit. I have learnt how to identify the crucial phases of  a project and ensure that they go on smoothly on time.
